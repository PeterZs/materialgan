## Overview
We don't provide the codes for GAN training, please refer to [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2).

## Pretrained model
Please download pretrained model and other necessary files [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~yug10/webpage/suppl/2020TOG/pretrained.zip).

## Input data
Please download real inputs from our paper [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~yug10/webpage/suppl/2020TOG/real_input.zip).
Or generate your own inputs by using `tool/generate_inputs.py`

## Optimization
To get the SVBRDF maps by optimization, please try `script_optim_ours.py`

## Updates 
02/04/2021: This is not the cleanup version. If you have difficulty running the codes or have questions about the codes/data/parameters, please send an email to Yu Guo (tflsguoyu@gmail.com). Sorry for the inconvenience.
